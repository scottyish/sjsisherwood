										Leveraging AI and patient metadata to develop a novel risk score for skin cancer
										detection
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										The WHO estimates between 2-3 million new cases of skin cancer (melanoma &
										non-melanoma types) each year. By eye, its extremely difficult to detect the tiny 
										differences in pigmentation, size or texture within medical images. 
										Image segmentation, detection,  and categorisation
										are things recent AI breakthroughs do very well at.
										By analysing data from over 53,000 skin lesions and integrating features
										such as size, colour and shape, the C4C Risk Score achieved a 69% accuracy rate,
										significantly higher than existing techniques. While the rapid improvement in AI
										tech has slowed considerably since ChatGPT-3 and the other equivalent models that hit the
										market,
										methods such as these display how the uses for AI in the medical field are
										constantly on the rise. Hoping to gain regulatory approval
										by 2025, this finding presents an opportunity for startups to enhance AI-driven
										diagnostic tools, addressing bottlenecks in healthcare and improving early
										cancer detection, particularly in overburdened systems like our NHS.

										Uric acid and alterations of purine recycling disorders in Parkinson’s disease:
										a cross-sectional study
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										A study from Fujita Health University, published in NPJ Parkinson’s Disease,
										uncovers critical disruptions in purine metabolism
										and ATP recycling in Parkinson’s disease (PD), highlighting energy deficits as a
										key factor in the disease’s progression. Researchers
										found that PD patients exhibit significantly lower levels of uric acid and
										hypoxanthine in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
										independent of upstream xanthine concentrations, challenging previous
										assumptions about purine metabolism. Reduced inosine levels in
										the CSF point to impaired nucleotide production in the brain, further
										implicating a dysfunctional energy system. These findings suggest
										that the hallmark energy metabolism disruption in PD could exacerbate symptoms,
										and targeting ATP recycling rather than simply elevating
										uric acid may offer more effective treatment strategies. This research provides
										a foundation for novel interventions, including metabolic
										therapies, exercise, and nutritional approaches, with potential to slow disease
										progression and improve patient outcomes. Such discoveries
										open avenues for startups to innovate in energy metabolism-targeted therapies
										and diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases.

									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										Another study displaying the potential of tools like <a href="https://github.com/mims-harvard/TxGNN"
										>TxGNN</a> to use already
										clincally trialed pharmacologicals to treat
										diseases they were not initially desgined for. The study demonstrates that IDO1
										inhibitors, originally
										developed for cancer treatment, could offer a novel approach for combating
										neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.
										These researchers showed that suppressing
										the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1
										(IDO1) restored healthy glucose metabolism in astrocytes—key brain cells
										supporting neurons—thereby reversing memory and
										cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s models. The protective effects were
										consistent across amyloid and tau pathologies, with implications for other
										disorders such as Parkinson’s disease dementia and
										tauopathies. This breakthrough highlights metabolic intervention as a promising
										frontier in neurodegeneration research, offering
										startups opportunities to repurpose existing drugs for targetting other diseases.

										Hybrid working from home improves retention without damaging performance
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										A new study provides an optimistic outlook on hybrid working. Whether or not
										hyprid working (defined as 2 or more days a week at home) truly effects performance
										has been a hot topic since the pandemic. This work, based on 1600 people from trip.com
										found no drop in productivity or career growth compared to full-time non-hypbrid workers.
										They also found a 33% reduction in resignation rates. Women, non-managers, and those with long 
										commutes appear to benefit the most. The study debunks myths that hybrid work is the same as fully 
										remote work and eases concerns about its downsides. It highlights how hybrid models can maintain 
										key elements like mentoring, innovation, and company culture, creating a so-called “win-win-win” for 
										employees, employers, and policymakers. Such findings bode well for newer co-working regimes.

										Differential sex-dependent susceptibility to diastolic dysfunction and
										arrhythmia in cardiomyocytes from obese diabetic heart failure with preserved
										ejection fraction model
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										A study by the UC Davis School of Medicine reveals sex-specific cellular
										mechanisms underlying heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in
										mice, with
										significant implications for tailored treatments. Male mice with HFpEF exhibited
										diastolic dysfunction due to slower calcium removal, leading to incomplete
										relaxation
										between heartbeats and higher arrhythmia risks. In contrast, female mice had
										normal calcium dynamics but showed increased stiffness from altered forms of the
										heart filament
										protein titin and troponin I phosphorylation. These findings suggest distinct
										therapeutic targets: reducing cardiac stiffness for women and enhancing calcium
										removal for men.
										Using a “two-hit” mouse model incorporating obesity, diabetes, and aldosterone
										infusion, the study underscores the critical need for sex-specific approaches in
										HFpEF research
										and treatment, potentially inspiring new precision medicine innovations for
										startups focusing on cardiovascular health. Such findings provide more backing
										for the formation of

										Vitamin D regulates microbiome-dependent cancer immunity
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										A study published in Science provides more evidence for the role of vitamin D in
										cancer immunity. The work reveals that vitamin D enhances cancer
										immunity in mice by promoting the growth of a gut bacterium,
										Bacteroides fragilis, which suppresses tumor growth. Researchers from the
										Francis Crick Institute and collaborators found that vitamin D
										acts on intestinal epithelial cells to increase this bacteria, improving
										resistance to transplanted tumors and boosting responses to immunotherapy.
										Mice with a vitamin D-rich diet or supplemented with Bacteroides fragilis
										exhibited better tumor suppression, though the effect was absent in vitamin
										D-deficient conditions. Analysis of Danish population data further supported an
										association between low vitamin D levels and higher cancer risk, while
										cancer patients with higher vitamin D showed better immunotherapy outcomes.
										Although these findings underscore vitamin D’s potential in modulating the
										microbiome for cancer immunity, the exact mechanisms remain unclear,
										necessitating further investigation. These insights open avenues for startups to
										explore microbiome-targeted therapies and dietary interventions to enhance
										immunotherapy effectiveness in cancer treatment.

										A new study sheds light on the long-term health impacts of COVID-19 compared to seasonal flu. 
										Whether COVID-19 leads to more severe long-term complications than influenza has been a topic 
										of ongoing debate. This research, based on hospitalised patients, found that COVID-19 patients 
										experienced higher rates of respiratory and cardiovascular issues than those admitted for flu. 
										The study also highlighted that these lasting effects underscore the need for better post-discharge 
										care and monitoring. By showing the importance of personalised management strategies, it offers 
										valuable insights into how healthcare systems can adapt. Such findings open up opportunities for 
										innovative solutions, like remote monitoring tools and tailored rehabilitation programs, which

										Association of PM2.5 Exposure and Alzheimer Disease Pathology in Brain Bank
										Donors—Effect Modification by APOE Genotype
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										A study published in Neurology links traffic-related air pollution exposure to
										higher levels of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease,
										in post-mortem brain analyses. Examining brain tissue from 224 individuals with
										an average age of 76, researchers found that exposure to fine particulate matter
										(PM2.5) in the year and three years prior to death significantly increased the
										likelihood of amyloid plaque accumulation. Notably, individuals without the APOE
										e4 gene variant exhibited the strongest correlation, highlighting the potential
										role of environmental factors in non-genetic Alzheimer’s cases. While the
										findings
										strengthen the evidence linking air pollution to neurodegeneration, limitations
										such as reliance on final home addresses and a homogenous study population
										warrant
										further investigation. These insights not only advance scientific understanding
										of environmental contributors to dementia but also suggest potential pathways
										for
										startups to innovate air quality monitoring and mitigation technologies aimed at

									<p class="publication-description">
										The study in The Lancet Neurology provides a comprehensive analysis of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a rare dementia syndrome often linked to Alzheimer’s disease. 
										The research, pooling data from 1,092 participants across 36 centers, highlights PCA’s association with early onset (mean age ~60), a predominance in women, and a strong 
										correlation with Alzheimer’s pathology (94% at autopsy). It identifies biomarkers such as amyloid-PET and tau-PET as critical diagnostic tools and underscores the need for

										Late-life shift in caloric intake affects fly metabolism and longevity
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										With the influx of personalised healthcare companies, and the huge rise in
										consumption of supplements, could there be more natural, simple methods
										to increase longevity? A recent study looked into the effects of caloric intake
										on metabolism and longevity in fruit flies. The researchers found that
										transitioning from a high-calorie
										to a low-calorie diet, even later in life, significantly reduced mortality rates
										and extended lifespan. Conversely, switching from
										a low-calorie to a high-calorie diet increased mortality and shortened lifespan.
										Diet has always been known to be important, across the sciences,
										but the timeline by at which such a change can effect the human body has been
										less studied. These findings suggest that dietary changes can
										rapidly influence aging processes, highlighting the potential for caloric
										restriction interventions to mitigate the adverse effects
										of high-calorie diets and promote longevity.

										The impact of founder personalities on startup success
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										Founders are obviously paramount when attempting to predict the success of a
										startup. This variability of this factor alone, makes normal methods
										of company valuation (DCF etc) useless in this space. So can we quantify what
										makes a good founder? Are the specfic traits that we can select for,
										to increase our odds of picking a winner? According to this paper, yes. They
										found that traits such as openness to experience, conscientiousness, and
										emotional stability are positively associated with startup performance. On the
										other side, high levels of neuroticism were linked to lower success rates.
										The findings suggest that the personality traits of founders play a significant
										role in the trajectory of a startup. While psychological facotrs are always

										Estimating the association between Facebook adoption and well-being in 72

									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										How social media (i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) effects cognitive,
										psychological and social development is still unclear.
										I think most of us have an implicit feeling that many aspects of the platforms
										must be detrimental for users, especially in adolescents.
										But how true is this? We are inundated with negative associations between social
										media use and health, but how much of this is based on real,
										tractable data? The findings of this paper indicate that the impact of social
										media on well-being is minimal, with effect sizes explaining less than 1% of the
										variation
										in mental health outcomes. This suggests that other factors, such as family
										environment and offline social interactions, play a more substantial
										role in adolescents’ mental health. This insight encourages a shift in focus
										from solely targeting social media usage to addressing broader environmental
										and personal factors that contribute to adolescents’ mental health. The results
										of this paper came as a suprise to me, as governments around the world rush
										to limit access to the platforms to minors.

										Geometric constraints on human brain function
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										We can all agree that the anatomy and architectural properties of the brain
										constrain its function.
										The exact mechanism, or mechanisms, that allow the relatively static
										neuroanatomy of the brain to
										give rise to the complex and dynamic spatiotemporal signalling cascades from
										which consciousness
										emerges, is unclear.
										Much of the field has based their research on the idea of more domain-specifc
										functions of brain areas, where
										differing functions can be ascribed to regions based on the properties of their
										neuronal subpopulations, and their connectivty
										to other regions. Less focus has looked at the geometry of the brain, which
										defines the path of least resistance and aspects of
										proximity and diffusion.
										This work challenges the classical paradigm of functionally specialised,
										connectivity-driven brain activity, instead
										identifying geometry as a central determinant of neuronal dynamics. By
										introducing a unifying, physically principled
										model of brain-wide activity, the findings redefine how large-scale dynamics are
										conceptualised, with significant implications
										for neuroimaging, computational modeling, and the study of structure-function
										relationships. This paradigm shift not only enhances
										our understanding of brain organisation but also provides a framework for
										exploring neurodevelopmental and pathological processes

										The e-skin uses nanotech and appears to be very accurate in its readings of
										pressure & strain detection, and temperature.
										Its self-healing properties and ability to interface with human skin make it a
										promising tool
										for applications in healthcare monitoring, robotics, and human-machine
										interactions. The research advances the field of bioelectronics by
										addressing durability and functionality challenges in wearable devices. Such
										tech could be the basis of many breakthroughs
										in personalised health diagnostics, prosthetics, and interactive robotics,
										opening new avenues for commercial exploitation in healthtech and
										assistive technologies.

										Vitamin D supplementation and incident dementia: Effects of sex, APOE, and
										baseline cognitive status
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										The study examined the relationship between
										vitamin D supplementation and the incidence of dementia. Using data from over
										12,000 dementia-free individuals, the group
										found a 40% lower incidence of dementia in those that took vitamin D supplements
										than those who didn't. The protective effect of vitamin D
										appears to be more pronounced in women and individuals without the APOE ε4 gene,
										which is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
										These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation could be a viable strategy
										for reducing dementia risk, particularly in specific
										populations. This research contributes to the understanding of modifiable risk
										factors for dementia and may influence public health
										recommendations regarding vitamin D intake. For the startup ecosystem, these
										insights could lead to the development of new preventive health
										products or services aimed at cognitive health maintenance, potentially
										benefiting aging populations.

										Association between cannabis use and blood pressure levels according to
										comorbidities and socioeconomic status
									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										The study investigated the relationship between cannabis consumption
										and blood pressure in adults in the US. Using data from the National Health and
										Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2005 and 2012, the group
										analysed the blood pressure of people with varying histories of cannabis use,
										adjusting for confounding factors such as age, sex,
										body mass index, and tobacco use. The findings indicate that current cannabis
										users had higher systolic
										and diastolic blood pressure levels compared to non-users. These results suggest
										a potential link between cannabis use and elevated blood pressure, highlighting
										the need for further research
										to understand the underlying mechanisms and long-term cardiovascular
										implications. With the relatively laxed outlook on cannabis use across many
										developed and underdeveloped countries,
										and uncertain understanding of the short or long-term effects of cannabis use,
										more work elucidating other potential risk factors is needed.

										Genome-wide association study of school grades identifies genetic overlap

									</a>
									<p class="papers-description">
										The study looked into the genetic factors influencing academic performance and
										their connections
										to language skills, mental health, and creativity. They analysed the genomes of
										30,982 individuals, and found
										that genetic variants associated with better lanugage ability also correlate
										with an increased risk for
										certain psychiatric disorders, notably schizophrenia. Such variants were also
										more prevalent in people in creative industries.
										Overall, these findings suggest that language ability, creativity, and
										susceptibility to certain mental
										health conditions may share common genetic roots. Understanding these
										connections could inform future educational strategies and mental health
										interventions,
										aiding the sector-wide focus on personalised healthcare
