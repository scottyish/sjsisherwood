									Leveraging AI and patient metadata to develop a novel risk score for skin cancer detection
								</a>
								<p class="publication-description">
									Researchers in the East of England have developed an AI-based tool for skin cancer detection that significantly outperforms existing methods. 
									Using data from over 53,000 skin lesions, the team identified seven key clinical features—such as recent changes in lesion size, color, and shape, 
									and patient hair color at age 15—integrated into the new C4C Risk Score. This model achieved 69% accuracy, surpassing traditional methods like 7PCL 
									and Williams score, which focus primarily on melanoma. By combining the C4C Risk Score with lesion images, the AI tool promises faster diagnoses, fewer 
									unnecessary biopsies, and improved outcomes for all skin cancer types, including basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Expected to gain regulatory approval 
									by 2025, this innovation presents an opportunity for startups to enhance AI-driven diagnostic tools, addressing healthcare bottlenecks and improving early 
									cancer detection, particularly in overburdened systems like the NHS.

									Uric acid and alterations of purine recycling disorders in Parkinson’s disease: a cross-sectional study
								</a>
								<p class="publication-description">
									A study from Fujita Health University, published in NPJ Parkinson’s Disease, uncovers critical disruptions in purine metabolism 
									and ATP recycling in Parkinson’s disease (PD), highlighting energy deficits as a key factor in the disease’s progression. Researchers 
									found that PD patients exhibit significantly lower levels of uric acid and hypoxanthine in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 
									independent of upstream xanthine concentrations, challenging previous assumptions about purine metabolism. Reduced inosine levels in 
									the CSF point to impaired nucleotide production in the brain, further implicating a dysfunctional energy system. These findings suggest 
									that the hallmark energy metabolism disruption in PD could exacerbate symptoms, and targeting ATP recycling rather than simply elevating 
									uric acid may offer more effective treatment strategies. This research provides a foundation for novel interventions, including metabolic 
									therapies, exercise, and nutritional approaches, with potential to slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Such discoveries 
									open avenues for startups to innovate in energy metabolism-targeted therapies and diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases.

									Restoring hippocampal glucose metabolism rescues cognition across Alzheimer’s disease pathologies
								</a>
								<p class="publication-description">
									Another study displaying the potential of businesses like *** to use already clincally trialed pharmacologicals to treat 
									diseases they were not initially desgined for. The study demonstrates that IDO1 inhibitors, originally 
									developed for cancer treatment, could offer a novel approach for combating neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. 
									Researchers from Penn State, Stanford, and collaborators showed that suppressing the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 
									(IDO1) restored healthy glucose metabolism in astrocytes—key brain cells supporting neurons—thereby reversing memory and 
									cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s models. By targeting the upstream metabolic dysfunction leading to amyloid and tau plaque 
									formation, IDO1 inhibition offers potential beyond symptom management, addressing disease onset. The protective effects were 
									consistent across amyloid and tau pathologies, with implications for other disorders such as Parkinson’s disease dementia and 
									tauopathies. This breakthrough highlights metabolic intervention as a promising frontier in neurodegeneration research, offering 
									startups opportunities to repurpose existing cancer drugs for precision therapies targeting brain metabolism and early-stage 
									neurodegenerative conditions.

									A recent study published in Nature presents the development of multi-heterojunctioned plastic materials exhibiting a high thermoelectric 
									figure of merit. These advanced plastics are engineered to efficiently convert temperature differences into electrical energy, offering 
									potential applications in energy harvesting and thermal management technologies. This innovation represents a significant advancement in 
									the field of thermoelectric materials, traditionally dominated by inorganic compounds. The introduction of high-performance, flexible, and 
									lightweight plastic-based thermoelectric materials opens new avenues for integrating energy conversion systems into wearable electronics, 
									portable devices, and other applications where traditional materials are less practical. For the startup ecosystem, this breakthrough provides 
									opportunities to develop novel products that leverage these materials for efficient energy harvesting and management, potentially leading to more

									Hybrid working from home improves retention without damaging performance
								</a>
								<p class="publication-description">
									A randomized controlled trial conducted by Nicholas Bloom and colleagues, published in Nature, reveals that hybrid work schedules, where employees work 
									from home two days per week, benefit both individuals and organizations. The study, involving 1,600 employees at Trip.com, showed no negative impact on 
									productivity or career advancement compared to full-time office work, while reducing resignation rates by 33%. Women, non-managers, and employees with long 
									commutes benefited most from reduced attrition, saving the company millions in turnover costs. The findings dispel misconceptions equating hybrid with fully 
									remote work and challenge managerial concerns about its potential drawbacks. Hybrid work preserves essential elements of mentoring, innovation, and company culture, 
									presenting a rare “win-win-win” scenario for employees, employers, and economic policy. This evidence supports wider adoption of hybrid models, which can inspire startups 
									to develop tools and strategies to optimize hybrid work environments, fostering retention and performance in competitive industries.

									Differential sex-dependent susceptibility to diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmia in cardiomyocytes from obese diabetic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction model
								</a>
								<p class="publication-description">
									A study by the UC Davis School of Medicine reveals sex-specific cellular mechanisms underlying heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in mice, with 
									significant implications for tailored treatments. Male mice with HFpEF exhibited diastolic dysfunction due to slower calcium removal, leading to incomplete relaxation 
									between heartbeats and higher arrhythmia risks. In contrast, female mice had normal calcium dynamics but showed increased stiffness from altered forms of the heart filament 
									protein titin and troponin I phosphorylation. These findings suggest distinct therapeutic targets: reducing cardiac stiffness for women and enhancing calcium removal for men. 
									Using a “two-hit” mouse model incorporating obesity, diabetes, and aldosterone infusion, the study underscores the critical need for sex-specific approaches in HFpEF research 
									and treatment, potentially inspiring new precision medicine innovations for startups focusing on cardiovascular health. Such findings provide more backing for the formation of
									personalised healthcare.

									Vitamin D regulates microbiome-dependent cancer immunity
								</a>
								<p class="publication-description">
									A study published in Science provides more evidence for the role of vitamin D in cancer immunity. The work reveals that vitamin D enhances cancer 
									immunity in mice by promoting the growth of a gut bacterium, 
									Bacteroides fragilis, which suppresses tumor growth. Researchers from the Francis Crick Institute and collaborators found that vitamin D 
									acts on intestinal epithelial cells to increase this bacteria, improving resistance to transplanted tumors and boosting responses to immunotherapy. 
									Mice with a vitamin D-rich diet or supplemented with Bacteroides fragilis exhibited better tumor suppression, though the effect was absent in vitamin 
									D-deficient conditions. Analysis of Danish population data further supported an association between low vitamin D levels and higher cancer risk, while 
									cancer patients with higher vitamin D showed better immunotherapy outcomes. Although these findings underscore vitamin D’s potential in modulating the 
									microbiome for cancer immunity, the exact mechanisms remain unclear, necessitating further investigation. These insights open avenues for startups to 
									explore microbiome-targeted therapies and dietary interventions to enhance immunotherapy effectiveness in cancer treatment.

								</a>
								<p class="publication-description">
									A study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in 2024 investigates the long-term outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 
									compared to those admitted for seasonal influenza. The research reveals that individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 experience higher rates 
									of long-term complications, including respiratory and cardiovascular issues, than those hospitalized with influenza. These findings underscore 
									the severe and lasting health impacts of COVID-19, highlighting the necessity for ongoing monitoring and tailored post-discharge care for affected patients.
									This study contributes to the understanding of COVID-19’s long-term health consequences, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive patient management

									Association of PM2.5 Exposure and Alzheimer Disease Pathology in Brain Bank Donors—Effect Modification by APOE Genotype
								</a>
								<p class="publication-description">
									A study published in Neurology links traffic-related air pollution exposure to higher levels of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, 
									in post-mortem brain analyses. Examining brain tissue from 224 individuals with an average age of 76, researchers found that exposure to fine particulate matter 
									(PM2.5) in the year and three years prior to death significantly increased the likelihood of amyloid plaque accumulation. Notably, individuals without the APOE 
									e4 gene variant exhibited the strongest correlation, highlighting the potential role of environmental factors in non-genetic Alzheimer’s cases. While the findings 
									strengthen the evidence linking air pollution to neurodegeneration, limitations such as reliance on final home addresses and a homogenous study population warrant 
									further investigation. These insights not only advance scientific understanding of environmental contributors to dementia but also suggest potential pathways for 
									startups to innovate air quality monitoring and mitigation technologies aimed at urban health challenges.

										Demographic, clinical, biomarker, and neuropathological correlates of posterior cortical atrophy: an international cohort study and individual participant data meta-analysis
									</a>
									<p class="publication-description">
										The study in The Lancet Neurology provides a comprehensive analysis of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a rare dementia syndrome often linked to Alzheimer’s disease. 
										The research, pooling data from 1,092 participants across 36 centers, highlights PCA’s association with early onset (mean age ~60), a predominance in women, and a strong 
										correlation with Alzheimer’s pathology (94% at autopsy). It identifies biomarkers such as amyloid-PET and tau-PET as critical diagnostic tools and underscores the need for

												 Late-life shift in caloric intake affects fly metabolism and longevity
											</a>
											<p class="publication-description">
												With the influx of personalised healthcare companies, and the huge rise in consumption of supplements, could there be more natural, simple methods 
												to increase longevity? A recent study looked into the effects of caloric intake  
												on metabolism and longevity in fruit flies. The researchers found that transitioning from a high-calorie 
												to a low-calorie diet, even later in life, significantly reduced mortality rates and extended lifespan. Conversely, switching from 
												a low-calorie to a high-calorie diet increased mortality and shortened lifespan. Diet has always been known to be important, across the sciences, 
												but the timeline by at which such a change can effect the human body has been less studied. These findings suggest that dietary changes can 
												rapidly influence aging processes, highlighting the potential for caloric restriction interventions to mitigate the adverse effects 
												of high-calorie diets and promote longevity.

												The impact of founder personalities on startup success
											</a>
											<p class="publication-description">
												Founders are obviously paramount when attempting to predict the success of a startup. This variability of this factor alone, makes normal methods 
												of company valuation (DCF etc) useless in this space. So can we quantify what makes a good founder? Are the specfic traits that we can select for,
												to increase our odds of picking a winner? According to this paper, yes. They found that traits such as openness to experience, conscientiousness, and 
												emotional stability are positively associated with startup performance. On the other side, high levels of neuroticism were linked to lower success rates. 
												The findings suggest that the personality traits of founders play a significant role in the trajectory of a startup. While psychological facotrs are always
												evaluated when deciding whether to invest in a startup, this is done in a qualitative heuristic way by humans, could a framework involving more quantitative 
												measuremnts of founders traits be more effective?

												Estimating the association between Facebook adoption and well-being in 72 countries
											</a>
											<p class="publication-description">
												How social media (i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) effects cognitive, psychological and social development is still unclear.
												I think most of us have an implicit feeling that many aspects of the platforms must be detrimental for users, especially in adolescents. 
												But how true is this? We are inundated with negative associations between social media use and health, but how much of this is based on real, 
												tractable data? The findings of this paper indicate that the impact of social media on well-being is minimal, with effect sizes explaining less than 1% of the variation 
												in mental health outcomes. This suggests that other factors, such as family environment and offline social interactions, play a more substantial 
												role in adolescents’ mental health. This insight encourages a shift in focus from solely targeting social media usage to addressing broader environmental 
												and personal factors that contribute to adolescents’ mental health. The results of this paper came as a suprise to me, as governments around the world rush 
												to limit access to the platforms to minors.

												This group investigated the role of taurine deficiency in aging. Researchers observed that taurine levels 
												decline with age in various species, including us. Supplementing taurine in middle-aged animals, such as mice and monkeys, 
												led to increased lifespan and improved health markers, including enhanced muscle strength, coordination, and immune function. 
												These findings suggest that taurine deficiency may be a driver of aging, and that taurine supplementation could be a potential 
												strategy to promote healthy aging. This research provides valuable insights into the biological mechanisms of aging, highlighting 
												taurine as a significant factor in the aging process. The study’s implications extend to developing dietary or pharmacological 
												interventions aimed at increasing taurine levels to enhance healthspan and longevity. With the rise of tailored healthcare and 
												huge number of companies selling supplements, this paper will likely give rise to additional avenues in this space.

												Geometric constraints on human brain function
											</a>
											<p class="publication-description">
												We can all agree that the anatomy and architectural properties of the brain constrain its function. 
												The exact mechanism, or mechanisms, that allow the relatively static neuroanatomy of the brain to 
												give rise to the complex and dynamic spatiotemporal signalling cascades from which consciousness
												emerges, is unclear. 
												Much of the field has based their research on the idea of more domain-specifc functions of brain areas, where 
												differing functions can be ascribed to regions based on the properties of their neuronal subpopulations, and their connectivty
												to other regions. Less focus has looked at the geometry of the brain, which defines the path of least resistance and aspects of
												proximity and diffusion. 
												This work challenges the classical paradigm of functionally specialized, connectivity-driven brain activity, instead 
												identifying geometry as a central determinant of neuronal dynamics. By introducing a unifying, physically principled 
												model of brain-wide activity, the findings redefine how large-scale dynamics are conceptualized, with significant implications 
												for neuroimaging, computational modeling, and the study of structure-function relationships. This paradigm shift not only enhances 
												our understanding of brain organization but also provides a framework for exploring neurodevelopmental and pathological processes 
												through the lens of geometry and wave dynamics.

												Engineering longevity—design of a synthetic gene oscillator to slow cellular aging
											</a>
											<p class="publication-description">
												The research group behind this study developed a soft electronic skin (e-skin) that has similar physical properties of skin (flexibility & stretchability), 
												and has integrated ciruits to 'sense' pressure changes, strain and temperature. The e-skin uses nanotech and appears to be very accurate in its readings of
												pressure & strain detection, and temperature.
												Its self-healing properties and ability to interface with human skin make it a promising tool 
												for applications in healthcare monitoring, robotics, and human-machine interactions. The research advances the field of bioelectronics by 
												addressing durability and functionality challenges in wearable devices. Such tech could be the basis of many breakthroughs 
												in personalized health diagnostics, prosthetics, and interactive robotics, opening new avenues for commercial exploitation in healthtech and 
												assistive technologies.

												Vitamin D supplementation and incident dementia: Effects of sex, APOE, and baseline cognitive status
											</a>
											<p class="publication-description">
												The study examined the relationship between 
												vitamin D supplementation and the incidence of dementia. Using data from over 12,000 dementia-free individuals, the group 
												found a 40% lower incidence of dementia in those that took vitamin D supplements than those who didn't. The protective effect of vitamin D
												appears to be more pronounced in women and individuals without the APOE ε4 gene, which is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.
												These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation could be a viable strategy for reducing dementia risk, particularly in specific 
												populations. This research contributes to the understanding of modifiable risk factors for dementia and may influence public health 
												recommendations regarding vitamin D intake. For the startup ecosystem, these insights could lead to the development of new preventive health 
												products or services aimed at cognitive health maintenance, potentially benefiting aging populations.

												Association between cannabis use and blood pressure levels according to comorbidities and socioeconomic status
											</a>
											<p class="publication-description">
												The study investigated the relationship between cannabis consumption 
												and blood pressure in adults in the US. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2005 and 2012, the group 
												analysed the blood pressure of people with varying histories of cannabis use, adjusting for confounding factors such as age, sex, 
												body mass index, and tobacco use. The findings indicate that current cannabis users had higher systolic 
												and diastolic blood pressure levels compared to non-users. These results suggest a potential link between cannabis use and elevated blood pressure, highlighting the need for further research 
												to understand the underlying mechanisms and long-term cardiovascular implications. With the relatively laxed outlook on cannabis use across many developed and underdeveloped countries, 
												and uncertain understanding of the short or long-term effects of cannabis use, more work elucidating other potential risk factors is needed.

												Genome-wide association study of school grades identifies genetic overlap between language ability, psychopathology and creativity
											</a>
											<p class="publication-description">
												The study looked into the genetic factors influencing academic performance and their connections 
												to language skills, mental health, and creativity. They analysed the genomes of 30,982 individuals, and found 
												that genetic variants associated with better lanugage ability also correlate with an increased risk for 
												certain psychiatric disorders, notably schizophrenia. Such variants were also more prevalent in people in creative industries. 
												Overall, these findings suggest that language ability, creativity, and susceptibility to certain mental 
												health conditions may share common genetic roots. Understanding these connections could inform future educational strategies and mental health interventions, 
												aiding the sector-wide focus on personalised healthcare
